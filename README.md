# sromcrom

A tool for converting modern graphic formats into the binary rom formats needed for a Neo Geo game, as well as emitting C code for integrating the graphics into your game.

## Status

This is a rewrite of an old graphics pipeline tool I wrote. Taking the lessons learned from that one I am building sromcrom to be flexible and easier to work on.

Currently very early, it only emits eyecatcher related imagery into C and S roms. But I don't think getting the old version fully ported over will take too long.
